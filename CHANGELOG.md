* Issue #41: Customizing the color of the squares in "Codemap explorer"

  You can use an additional format for icon allows specifying custom path:

  The path string can contain special token `{theme}` which is replaced at runtime with the word "dark" or "light". Depending on the VS theme.  

  ```
      "codemap.md": [
        {
            "pattern": "^(\\s*)### (.*)",
            "clear": "###",
            "prefix": "Â -",
            "icon": "path:E:\\icons\\VSCode\\codemap\\{theme}\\custom_level_a.svg"
        },
        . . .
